      "But when Alana first auctioned online, thousands of dollars came in, and he sold 16 images for 100,000 Canadian dollars.\n",
      "Allerna said the experience at the time was \"so amazing\" and \"it was like a dream to see people really buy my work.\"\n",
      "Alan My work 'ETHical' sold for about $17,000 and the success of the auction completely changed his life.\n",
      "He was able to pay back all his credit card debts, pay for his college degree, and move to a bigger house in the suburbs.\n",
      "And finally, he could spend money on the treatment of his son Ron, who has autism, ADHD and Tourette's syndrome.\n",
      "Alana also hopes her success will help more female writers make inroads into the NFT.\n",
      "He said female writers were having a hard time getting into the \"male-dominated\" NFT.\n",
      "\"The door is wide open.\n",
      "The possibilities are endless.\n",
      "I now have a more positive and hopeful outlook on life.\n",
      "\"Allah, I added.\n",
      "\"I'm making my work with all my soul and making money from it.\n",
      "I never thought it would be possible until then.\n",
      "\"What is NFT and how does it work? NFT is a digital certificate that certifies who owns a particular asset.\n",
      "In the world of NFT art, each token (NFT) corresponds to the ownership of a genuine work of art.\n",
      "These talks exist as blockchain technology used in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, and contain details such as who made the work and when it was sold to whom.\n",
      "the vast use of energy in bitcoin\n",
      ".\n",
      "Maybe it's the rice cake look. Since Nigeria has become a global leader in bitcoin transactions, anyone can see the image of the work online, but only those who purchased the NFT of the work can claim ownership.\n",
      "It is also possible to sell the token back to someone else.\n",
      "The original author of the work maintains the intellectual property rights of the work linked to the NFT and can receive royalties whenever the token is sold.\n",
      "Darius Puig, a 30-year-old 3D artist living in Karlsruhe, Germany, \"was virtually bankrupt\" and decided to jump directly into the world of NFT art when he saw his friends selling his work online.\n",

      "I didn't expect it to be sold at such a high price.\n",
      "\"He said.\n",

      "\"He said.\n",
      "\"Now, if you think you need something, you can buy it right away.\n",
      "It's a great help to me mentally.\n",
      "Darius, who donated part of his income to the Mental Health Foundation, said it was a \"very healthy environment\" despite the considerable amount of money being exchanged in the world of the NFT.\n",
      "\"Because artists' values are recognized.\n",
      "I'm finally being treated.\n",
      "\"Giving equal opportunities\" does not mean that only paintings or illustrations are sold as NFTs.\n",
      "Argentine author Bruno Nassifer (37) sold GIF animation files and installed solar energy on his farm with the money.\n",

      "Cybershakti, an Indian glitch artist and photographer, agrees.\n",
      "He says the NFT \"gives hope for sustainable financial independence.\"\n",
      "\"The traditional world of art has been closed to self-taught artists, but the world of NFT gives us equal opportunities.\n",
      "After five months of NFT, the average unit price for my work has gone from $80 to $800.800.\n",
      "\"Who is buying NFT? Professor Raga Bendraw, who teaches finance at Cambridge University, says the surge in interest in NFT may be due to the fandom's search for ways to spend money more \"interestingly.\"\n",
      "He predicts that most NFT writers' sales will go up and disappear to some extent, and that only a few artists' demand will last longer.\n",
      "\"There have been several bubble situations in the past where prices of goods have been separated from fundamentals and continue to soar.\n",

      "You could lose a lot of money.\n",
      "\"NFT lover and collector Nelson Barker, 26, describes the NFT art movement as a \"rebellion\" against those who \"are trying to steal value from writers.\"\n",
      "Robaku, who lives in Chicago, says he has spent about $20,000 on NFT art since January so far, and that NFT will be the foundation for the way we do business in the future, calling it a \"promising investment opportunity.\"\n",
      "\"I'm very interested in supporting artists.\n",
      "I also support allowing artists to be financially more independent and to preserve their rights to the work.\n",
